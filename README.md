  This project was implemented according to the following requirements:

Task
Development Stack:

Develop a website using Node.js (Express) for the server and React for the client.
Task Assignment:

Define and implement a minimum of four models related to the subject area of previous assignments, utilizing built-in validators and appropriate data types. MongoDB is recommended as the database, but other databases are allowed.

For an authorized user, implement CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations and the ability to search and sort records. Use React-created forms for adding entries.

For an unauthorized user, provide only viewing, searching, sorting, and authorization functionality.

Populate data for demonstration purposes with at least 10 entries in the list of goods/services/objects/clients.

Connect and use at least two external APIs, chosen based on preference.

Display the user's time zone, current date, and the date of data addition/modification in tables for the user's time zone and UTC.

Use only React for creating all pages (minimum of four - choose any from previous assignments, including a catalog and viewing information about an object from the catalog). Switch between them using a navigation panel.

Create components:

Utilize declarative functions, arrow functions, and classes.
Apply props and default values.
Use developed components within other components.
Add event handlers (minimum of seven) in functional components, class components, with passing parameters to the event handler (3 – login.js, 3 – registration.js, NavBar.js).
Demonstrate working with state.
Demonstrate the use of any of the hooks.
Ensure an acceptable appearance using CSS (without https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/).

Validate forms on both the server side (check for the possibility of email in userController.js) and the client side (Registration.js, Login.js).

Restrict the usage of the project's API for unauthorized requests.
